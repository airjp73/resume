# Resume

Welcome to my resume!

I wasn't satisfied with using a resume builder or a template,
and I didn't want to write a plain text resume.
So I decided to write my resume with MDX and generate a PDF from it.

## Building the PDF

The requires you to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed.

Clone the repo, the run

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

The resume is now saved as `./dist/resume.pdf`.
